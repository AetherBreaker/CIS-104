    f"Version management software should be used for any project that is intended to be used "
    f"more than once, if you are writing a single use script, you probably don't need version "
    f"management software, but if you are creating a project meant to be used either by others "
    f"or yourself more than once, you should use version management.\n"
    f"Additionally you should use version management software if you are making a collaborative "
    f"project. If there is more than one person working with and modifying the code of a project, "
    f"it should almost certainly be using version management software."

print("Why?")
print(
    f"If at the very minimum, simply to make your life easier, there will be plenty of times "
    f"where you commit a breaking change, or end up introducing a bug into your code that wasn't "
    f"previously there, and version management will help you weed out the source of it.\n"
    f"Additionally version management also conveniently acts as a backup of your project, "
    f"if anything were to happen to your local project, you'll always have some sort of backup "
    f"elsewhere, including backups of previous versions.\n"
    f"During collaborative projects, version management software will also help significantly with "
    f"keeping the project organized, and will make coordinating code changes with your collaborators "
    f"much more seamless."
